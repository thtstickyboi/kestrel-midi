# Kestrel

'*experimental*'

A GPU-accelerated SoundFont/SFZ synthesizer for Black MIDI.

Kestrel renders a MIDI file to a WAV offline, doing the synthesis in compute
shaders instead of on the CPU. It is built for files where the note count is
absurd -- hundreds of millions of notes, with a hundred thousand to several
million voices sounding at once -- which is the point where conventional synths
stop being fast enough.

On an RTX 5060 Laptop it sustains **1,048,576 concurrent voices at 1.02x
realtime**.

It is a library and a command-line tool. There is no GUI, no realtime playback,
and no plugin build.

## Read this first: Kestrel is 100% vibecoded

**Every line of code in this repository was written by an AI.** Not
AI-assisted, not AI-reviewed -- AI-written, start to finish, from the shaders to
the SF2 parser to the limiter. I directed the work, made the design calls, ran
the renders and decided what was acceptable, but I did not hand-write this code
and I have not read every line of it.

What that means for you, concretely:

- **No human has line-by-line reviewed this code.** Not me, not anyone. If you
  are the sort of person who reads a diff before running it, read this one.
- **It was developed against a test suite**, which is *not* included in this
  repository: null tests against a separate single-threaded CPU reference
  implementation, byte-for-byte determinism checks, phase-accumulator precision
  tests, and envelope curves checked against analytically computed ones. The
  GPU path matched the CPU reference to better than -100 dB. That is real
  verification and it caught real bugs -- but you are taking my word for it,
  because the evidence is not in this repo.
- **The corners are where it will break.** The paths that got exercised
  constantly -- SF2 loading, the render loop, voice stealing under saturation --
  are in decent shape. Unusual soundfonts, exotic SFZ opcodes and malformed
  MIDI are much less certain.
- **Check the output yourself.** Do not put this in a pipeline you care about
  and assume the WAV is fine. Scan it. `kestrel null` exists precisely so you
  can diff a render against a reference you trust.

I am not claiming this is production software. I am claiming it renders black
MIDI fast and the output sounded right to me. Use it accordingly, and please
open an issue when it breaks, because it will.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **Rust** | 1.80 or newer, from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) |
| **GPU** | Anything with a working Vulkan, DX12 or Metal driver |
| **VRAM** | Depends on the soundfont and `--max-voices`; see below. Tuned against 8 GB |
| **OS** | Windows, Linux, macOS. Only Windows has been *run*; see below |

There are no system libraries to install and nothing to download separately.
Every dependency comes from crates.io, and the shaders are compiled into the
binary.

**Tested on NVIDIA and Intel, both on Windows via Vulkan.** The two agree:
rendering the same file on an RTX 5060 and on an Intel iGPU nulls at
**-111 dB peak, -127 dB RMS**, and each device is byte-identical with itself
across runs. That is worth more than it sounds -- WGSL is compiled by your
driver, not by cargo, so Intel's shader compiler is an entirely separate path
from NVIDIA's, and the two producing the same audio is real evidence the
shaders are portable.

Linux and macOS **compile** clean -- `cargo check --all-targets` passes for
`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `aarch64-apple-darwin`, which type-checks wgpu's
Vulkan and Metal backends along with everything else. Neither has been linked
or run, so that is one step short of a guarantee. There is no platform-specific
code in the crate and no C dependencies, which is the reason to expect it to
work rather than a promise that it does.

AMD, Apple silicon and Linux are still unrun. If you are first on one of
those, please open an issue either way; a report that it simply worked is as
useful as a crash.

Integrated GPUs are slower but genuinely usable -- the Intel part held 2.95x
realtime against the 5060's 32.5x on the same 100k-note file, which is about
what shared DDR5 against dedicated VRAM predicts for a bandwidth-bound
workload. Kestrel prefers a discrete GPU when both are present, so you will not
land on the slow one by accident.

Kestrel requests whatever limits your adapter reports rather than demanding a
fixed set, and it checks the ones it can before allocating: if the render pass
needs more workgroup storage than your card offers, or `--max-voices` implies a
voice pool larger than your card will bind, it stops and tells you which flag to
lower. It does not degrade quietly.

That second ceiling is per-card, and it is worth knowing where it comes from.
The voice pool is one storage buffer, and every adapter caps how much of a
single buffer a shader may bind at once. At 96 bytes per slot, and with the pool
holding `--max-voices` *plus* the `--steal-percent` fade headroom, a 2 GiB
binding limit works out to **17,895,696 voices** at the defaults -- that is what
an RTX 5060 allows. An Intel RaptorLake-S iGPU reports 1 GiB and so allows
8,947,848. Kestrel reads the limit off the device, so the error names the figure
for *your* card and *your* `--steal-percent` rather than a number from this
page. The dispatch grid is not a factor: every per-voice pass strides over the
pool, so the grid never has to cover it.

The cap is on the pool, not on the piece. A file with more simultaneous notes
than the pool holds still renders, with the excess stolen and dropped, which is
what the pool does at any size.

The GPU is the point, but there is a **complete CPU backend** -- it is the
reference implementation the GPU path was built against, so it produces correct
output on any machine. It is far slower and it is single-threaded. Use
`--backend cpu` if you have no usable GPU, or to check a suspicious render
against something simpler.

**VRAM is usually the binding constraint, not compute.** You do not have to
guess at it -- Kestrel prints the exact breakdown on startup:

```
gpu: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Laptop GPU (Vulkan) | 339.6 MiB of device buffers
(0.0 MiB sample pool, 240.0 MiB voice pool for 1310720 voices, 64.0 MiB partials)
```

Three things allocate:

- **The voice pool**, sized by `--max-voices`. The default of 1,048,576 costs
  240 MiB. It scales linearly, so 4M voices costs roughly 960 MiB, and a pool
  at a 2 GiB binding limit costs 4 GiB here plus 512 MiB of scan and sort
  scratch.
- **The partial buffers** used by the mixdown, sized by `--render-workgroups`
  and `--block`. 64 MiB at the defaults.
- **The sample pool**, which is your entire soundfont resampled to one rate. A
  large multi-sampled piano runs to hundreds of megabytes.

**Host RAM is a separate constraint, and on very large files it is the binding
one.** A block is admitted as a whole, so every note-on inside it is held in
memory until the block ends. That scales with `--block`: a 6.6 GB, 824M-note
file has one 512-frame block carrying 94 million note-ons, which costs about
4.8 GiB at `--block 512` and roughly eight times that at the 4096 default. If a
render dies with a failed allocation rather than a GPU error, lower `--block`
-- 512, 256 and 128 are all valid, 128 being the floor. Lowering `--max-voices`
does *not* help, because the block is considered in full before admission thins
it.

If the sample pool will not fit within `--pool-budget` (2 GB by default),
Kestrel halves its sample rate until it does rather than failing, on the
grounds that a downsampled render beats no render. Lower that budget on a
smaller card, and lower `--max-voices` with it.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thtstickyboi/kestrel-midi.git
```

```bash
cd kestrel-midi && cargo build --release
```

Build it in **release mode**. The debug build is not merely slower, it is
unusable for real files.

The binary lands at `target/release/kestrel`, or `target\release\kestrel.exe`
on Windows. It is self-contained, so you can copy it anywhere.

Check that your GPU was found before anything else:

```bash
kestrel gpu-info
```

If that lists no adapter, your driver is the problem, and `--backend cpu` is
the fallback.

## Running

The basic form:

```bash
kestrel render input.mid -s soundfont.sfz -o output.wav
```

`-s` takes a `.sf2` or a `.sfz`. Output is 32-bit float WAV by default; pass
`--format pcm16` for 16-bit.

An SFZ library's sample files may be WAV or FLAC. Which one is decided by
reading the file, not by its extension, because libraries ship FLAC under names
of their own invention and dispatching on the name silently drops every region
that uses one.

A more realistic invocation for a large file:

```bash
kestrel render huge.mid -s piano.sfz -o out.wav --max-voices 2000000 --profile
```
```bash
kestrel render huge.mid -s piano.sfz -o out.wav --limiter brickwall --profile
```

### The flags that actually matter

| Flag | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `--backend` | `gpu` | `cpu` is the reference implementation: correct, slow, single-threaded. |
| `--block N` | `4096` | Frames per render block. Also sets how many note-ons are held in host RAM at once; lower it if a huge file exhausts memory. |
| `--max-voices N` | `1048576` | Ceiling on simultaneous voices. The single biggest lever on both VRAM and speed. The maximum is whatever your card will bind; it is 17,895,696 on an RTX 5060 at the default `--steal-percent`, and the error names yours. |
| `--interp` | `linear` | `nearest`, `linear` or `cubic`. Cubic costs roughly double the bandwidth. |
| `--seconds N` | off | Stop after N seconds of output. Use this constantly while experimenting. |
| `--profile` | off | Per-pass GPU timings, once per wall-clock second. |
| `--block-csv` | off | One CSV row per block: voices alive at the admission decision, layers queued and admitted, voices stolen and dropped, output RMS and peak. The audio is downstream of these numbers, so read them rather than the waveform when level moves at the block rate. |
| `--limiter` | `brickwall` | `brickwall`, `omni` or `off`. See *Limiting*. |
| `--steal` | `quietest` | `quietest`, `oldest` or `drop-new`. See *Voice stealing*. |
| `--admit` | `loudest` | `loudest` or `even`. Which note-ons survive when a block oversubscribes the pool. See *Admission*. |
| `--volume X` | `1.0` | Pre-limiter gain. |
| `--rate N` | `48000` | Output sample rate. |
| `--format` | `float32` | `float32` or `pcm16`. |
| `--nan-guard` | off | Check every block for NaN and Inf. **Off in release builds**, so a clean exit is not by itself proof the WAV is finite. |
| `--gpu-backend`, `--gpu-adapter` | off | Force a specific API or card on multi-GPU machines. |

`kestrel render --help` lists everything, including the tuning knobs
(`--block`, `--workgroup`, `--reduce-tile`, `--pool-budget`) that are best left
alone unless you are measuring.

### The other commands

```bash
kestrel gpu-info                  # adapters, their limits, and each one's --max-voices ceiling
kestrel info file.sf2             # dump what the loader made of a soundfont
kestrel info file.mid             # ...or of a MIDI: note counts, CC usage, tempo, density
kestrel null a.wav b.wav          # peak difference between two renders, in dB
kestrel gen-assets dir/           # write synthetic soundfonts and MIDI
```

`kestrel info` is the first thing to reach for when a render sounds wrong. It
tells you what Kestrel *thinks* your file contains, which is often not what you
think it contains.

On a MIDI it also sizes the job before you start it. Pass the settings you mean
to render with:

```bash
kestrel info huge.mid --block 512 --layers 2 --release 1.5
```

```
at --block 512, --layers 2, 48000 Hz:
  busiest block        94289755 note-ons, at 286.66s
  host memory          5.27 GiB for that block, at least
  peak 1.50s span     386892142 voices, at 285.30s -- roughly what a pool
                                must hold for nothing to be stolen
```

The first two lines are the ones that decide whether a render survives: a block
is admitted whole, so every note-on in it is held until the block ends, and that
is what a failed allocation is. The third estimates the pool the file wants.
`--layers` is voices per note-on, one for most black MIDI banks and two for a
velocity-split piano; `--release` is the soundfont's release time, since in this
repertoire a voice's life is almost entirely its release tail. On a file whose
measured requirement was 14,035,344 voices, `--layers 2 --release 1.5` estimates
13,943,010.

**When to stop using the defaults.** Read those three lines and act on them:

| what `info` says | what to do |
|---|---|
| peak span under `--max-voices` | nothing. The defaults will not drop or steal a single voice |
| peak span above it | raise `--max-voices` towards that figure, up to the ceiling `gpu-info` prints for your card |
| host memory in the gigabytes | lower `--block`. Not `--max-voices` -- that does not help |

For anything that is not black MIDI the first row is the answer and there is
nothing to tune: a pool that never fills means admission and voice stealing
never run at all.

`gpu-info` prints each adapter's `--max-voices` ceiling directly rather than
leaving you to divide its buffer limit by hand. The voice pool is one storage
buffer, so how much of one buffer an adapter will bind is what caps the flag.

`gen-assets` writes reproducible synthetic material for benchmarking. Add
`--big-mb 512` for a sample pool too large to sit in cache, and
`--sustained 1500000` for a MIDI that holds the voice pool permanently full:

```bash
kestrel gen-assets bench --big-mb 512 --sustained 1500000
```

```bash
kestrel render bench/sustained1500000.mid -s bench/big512.sf2 -o bench.wav --profile --seconds 10
```

## Limiting

Black MIDI mixes clip constantly -- a saturated section can peak at hundreds of
times full scale -- so what happens at the ceiling matters more than usual.

**`brickwall`** (default) is a lookahead true-peak limiter. It sees peaks
before they arrive and cannot exceed its ceiling, so nothing downstream ever
has to hard-clip. `--ceiling-db`, `--lookahead-ms` and `--limiter-release-ms`
control it. The lookahead is also the render latency, which for an offline
renderer costs nothing.

**`omni`** is a port of the realtime limiter OmniConverter ships, originally
from Kiva. It is a feedback follower: it only sees a peak once the peak has
already passed, which is why it needs a third of a second of release, and that
release audibly drags the level down after every loud moment. It also does not
bound its own output, so samples still get clipped behind it. **Keep it only
for level-matching a render against BASS or XSynth**, which is the one thing it
does better.

**`off`** disables limiting. Your mix will clip. Combine with `--volume` if you
want to handle headroom yourself.

## Admission

Stealing decides who dies. **Admission decides who never starts**, and on a
saturated file that is the bigger number by an order of magnitude -- on a
44.7M-note file against a 32,767-voice pool, 83.7M note-ons were dropped
against 5.7M voices stolen. Whatever rule governs admission is deciding most of
what you hear.

How much of that you face at all is a function of pool size, and the pool can be
far larger than the default. On that same 44.7M-note file against an RTX 5060:

| `--max-voices` | dropped | stolen | realtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1,048,576 (default) | 18,682,538 | 57,113,653 | 1.43x |
| 13,421,568 | 0 | 2,732,530 | -- |
| 17,895,696 | **0** | **0** | 0.67x |

That file's true peak is **14,035,344 simultaneous voices**, and the bottom row
is the first pool that neither drops nor steals anything: every note sounding,
none refused and none cut short. It costs 5.3 GiB of VRAM and 2.1x the wall
time.

Two things are worth taking from the middle row. Admission stops mattering well
before stealing does -- a pool can admit every note-on and still be under enough
pressure to steal millions of voices. And an oversized pool costs memory rather
than time: 17,895,696 slots took 196.4 s against 14,000,000's 196.0 s, a 28%
larger pool for 0.2% more wall time, because every dispatch is sized from the
voices that are live and not from the pool. So overshoot `--max-voices` if the
VRAM is there. It is a far bigger lever than the choice of admission rule.

**`loudest`** (default) cuts an oversubscribed block into 64 time strata and
ranks *within* each one, so every stratum keeps its own share. Ranking the
block as a whole does not work: the loudest notes have no reason to be spread
evenly in time, they cluster on chords and downbeats, and the admitted set then
piles up at the block's opening and thins toward its end -- audible as pumping
at the block rate on material dropping around half its voices. A stratum is
1.3 ms, far too short to cluster audibly, and wide enough that ranking inside
it is still a real choice.

The rank itself is a 64-bit key: the note's opening amplitude on a logarithmic
scale, then a scrambled candidate index as a tiebreak. The amplitude term is
the voice's real opening gain -- it already carries the velocity, the region's
own attenuation and its pan -- rather than a raw velocity byte. The scramble
makes the key a total order with no ties, so the admitted set is a pure
function of the input.

Both halves of that sentence were wrong before 0.2.4, and between them they
were the largest source of block-rate pumping in the renderer.

The amplitude term used to be `(gain_l + gain_r)` clamped to 1.0 and quantised.
A loud soundfont at unity volume puts nearly every voice above 1.0, so the
field **saturated**: on a loud sampled piano the queued mean measured 32,470
of a possible 32,767 and the admitted mean 32,767.00 exactly.
Carrying no information, it left the tiebreak deciding almost every
comparison. It is now taken from the float's own bit pattern, which is
monotonic in the value and whose exponent field is literally log2 -- a
logarithmic rank for one shift, with nothing to saturate against.

The tiebreak used to be the raw note id. Ids are handed out in time order, so
every tie resolved toward the later note -- a rank that is a function of *when
a note arrives*, applied inside time strata whose entire purpose is to keep
rank and time independent.

And there used to be a third field, ranked above both: whether the note was
still sounding at the end of *this block*. That is a fact about where in the
block a note falls rather than about the note, and for the tick-length notes
black MIDI is made of it is very nearly a function of position alone. Its
justification was that a note whose note-off has already arrived is cheap to
drop because nothing is lost past the block boundary, which holds only if
release is instant. A sampled piano releases over seconds, so the release tail
*is* the voice. It was removed.

Measured as amplitude modulation at the block rate over the worst six seconds
of a saturated section, limiter off:

| | AM depth | peak-to-trough |
|---|---|---|
| before | 26.31% | 4.68 dB |
| tiebreak and amplitude fixed | 16.49% | 2.89 dB |
| **and the block-relative field removed** | **1.23%** | **0.21 dB** |
| `--admit even`, which ranks by nothing | 1.33% | 0.23 dB |

1.23% against a 1.33% floor means there is no block-rate component left for
admission to remove. The within-block level profile spans 0.66 dB where it
spanned 5.71 dB before.

**`even`** thins the block by position in time and ignores what each note is,
which is what the renderer did before ranking existed. It is blind in a
specific way: a fortissimo whole note and a 10 ms grace note have identical
odds of survival.

Measured at `--max-voices 32767`, `loudest` against `even`:

| | `even` | `loudest` |
|---|---|---|
| RMS | -11.225 dB | **-10.065 dB** |
| crest factor | 11.225 dB | **10.065 dB** |
| samples above 0.01 | 88.7% | **93.7%** |

A higher RMS at an identical peak, with a lower crest factor, is what "the long
loud notes survived" looks like as a number.

Those figures date from 0.2.2 and a smaller pool, and the gap narrows sharply
as the pool grows: at the default 1,048,576 voices the two rules now render
within 0.01 dB RMS of each other. The difference `loudest` buys is
largest exactly where the pool is smallest relative to the material, which is
also where it matters most.

One limit worth knowing: **there is no duration term at all.** The
block-relative field removed above was the only thing standing in for "this
note will actually sound for a while", crude as it was. Ranking is now purely
by opening amplitude, so a loud note cut short and a loud note held both look
the same to it. Expressing duration properly needs one block of lookahead --
free for offline rendering, and unlike the field it replaces it would be a
property of the note rather than of the block.

## Voice stealing

When more notes arrive than the pool can hold, something has to give. The rule
is fixed and deterministic, never dependent on scheduling order, because that
would make renders non-reproducible.

**`quietest`** (default) kills the voices with the lowest envelope level, ties
broken by note id. These contribute least to the mix.

**`oldest`** kills the earliest-started voices. This sounds backwards under
saturation and it is: the oldest voices are the mature, sounding ones, while
the survivors are whichever were struck most recently and are therefore still
silent.

**`drop-new`** refuses the incoming note instead of killing an existing one.

`--steal-percent` (25 by default) caps how much of the pool a single block may
replace. This matters more than it sounds. Unbounded, a block whose note-ons
outnumber the pool replaces *every* voice, so no voice outlives the block it
was born in and a saturated passage renders as a stream of 85 ms attack
fragments instead of notes. Setting it to 100 restores that behaviour, which is
useful only for hearing the difference.

## How it works

One command buffer per audio block, five compute passes: **steal**, **spawn**,
**render**, **reduce**, **compact**. The host parses MIDI and resolves presets,
which is branchy table-lookup work that stays on the CPU permanently, and the
device does everything per-voice and per-sample.

A few decisions worth knowing about if you plan to read the code:

**Renders are byte-identical.** Two runs of the same file with the same
settings produce bitwise identical WAVs. Nothing in the render path uses a
floating-point atomic, because float atomics are non-deterministic in ordering.
The mixdown is a fixed-order tree reduction into per-workgroup partial buffers
that no other workgroup touches; voice slots are assigned by index rather than
from an atomic counter; the pool sort is a stable radix sort. The only atomics
in the codebase are integer histogram bins, where addition is exact and
order-independent.

**Phase is 32.32 fixed point**, not float. f32 loses fractional resolution past
2^24 samples, which is audible as detuning on long samples, and f64 costs real
throughput on consumer NVIDIA parts. WGSL has no portable u64, so the device
holds it as two u32 lanes.

**The voice pool is structure-of-arrays** inside a single storage buffer: field
`f` of voice `i` lives at `f * capacity + i`. It is re-sorted by sample region
every block during compaction, so neighbouring invocations hit the same cache
lines. This workload is memory-bandwidth bound -- roughly 20 flops per voice
per frame against one scattered global read -- so the access pattern is worth
far more than the arithmetic.

**Note-offs do not search the pool.** The pool is reordered every block, so a
voice cannot be found by index. Instead the lookup is inverted: the host
publishes a small table of how many note-offs each (channel, key) has seen, and
each voice compares its own ordinal against it.

## Known limitations

- **No effects.** No reverb, no chorus. The controllers that would need them
  (CC91 reverb, CC93 chorus, CC94 celeste, CC95 phaser) are recognised but do
  nothing. Run `kestrel info` on a MIDI first: it lists every controller the
  file uses, marks the unimplemented ones `MISSING`, and tells you what
  percentage of the file's controller events fall in that bucket.
- **Notes can keep sounding after the music stops, on some soundfonts.**
  Reported on a 44.7M-note file: from roughly two thirds of the way in, notes
  sound in a region with no note-ons behind them. It reproduces at every pool
  size tried and on one soundfont but not another, which is the clue --
  suspicion is that note-offs arriving while the sustain pedal (CC64) is down
  are deferred and never released if the pedal does not come back up. Those
  voices then sound until their sample runs out, so a library with long
  reverb-tail samples makes it obvious while a drier one hides it. Not yet
  root-caused; if you hear it, `--limiter off` and a shorter-sampled soundfont
  will tell you quickly whether you are looking at the same thing.
- **No realtime playback.** Offline rendering to WAV only.
- **No host integration.** There is no C ABI and no plugin build, so nothing
  else can currently drive this as a backend.
- **Pitch bend and channel volume/pan reach a voice up to 32 frames late**
  (0.67 ms) when the controller lands on the note's own tick. Ordinary
  controllers do not have this problem; these two were left on the older
  timing deliberately, because the consequence is bounded and the fix changes
  timing elsewhere.
- **SFZ `lorand`/`hirand` are ignored, so random region selection does not
  work.** *(Very likely fixed in the next release -- see below.)* A soundfont
  that uses random slices to choose between alternative regions gets **all of
  them at once** rather than one. Ten slices per velocity layer is a common
  arrangement, and that is then ten times the intended voice count on every
  note. Worse, when the alternatives differ only by a small sample offset --
  the usual trick for keeping repeated notes from phase-locking -- summing them
  comb-filters the tone rather than merely making it louder. Kestrel warns when
  it sees these opcodes, so you will not hit this silently. Until it is fixed,
  use a preset that does not use `lorand` (most packs ship one), or cap
  `--layers`.
- **SFZ support is otherwise partial.** The common opcodes work, including
  `#include`, velocity layers, `fil_veltrack`, `amp_veltrack`, `key`,
  `loopstart`/`loopend`, `pitch_keytrack` and `off_by` where it names its own
  group. Several of those arrived in 0.2.4 -- see the release notes below,
  because two of them were loading libraries wrongly rather than merely
  ignoring them. Per-voice LFOs (`amplfo_*`,
  `fillfo_*`, `pitchlfo_*`) are recognised and reported, not applied -- though
  note that an LFO with a rate and no `*_depth` opcode would do nothing anyway,
  which is the common case in piano libraries.
- **NaN checking is off in release builds** unless you pass `--nan-guard`.

## What changed in 0.2.4

**Renders are not bit-compatible with 0.2.3.** Admission picks different notes
now, so every output differs. Two runs of the same file on the same build are
still byte-identical -- that guarantee is unchanged and is checked on real
material, not just synthetics.

### Block-rate pumping in saturated sections is fixed

Three defects in the admission key, described in full under *Admission* above.
The short version: its amplitude field saturated and carried no information,
its tiebreak resolved every tie toward later notes, and its top-ranked field
was a fact about where in the block a note fell rather than about the note.
Together they tilted the level inside every block.

Over the worst six seconds of a saturated section, amplitude modulation at the
block rate went from **26.31% to 1.23%** -- level with the 1.33% that
`--admit even` reaches by not ranking at all, which is the floor. The
within-block level profile went from 5.71 dB to 0.66 dB.

Checked across six large files at stock defaults, from 45 million to 2.7
billion notes. Worst case in that set is 0.73 dB peak-to-trough.

### Seven SFZ loading defects

Two of these were loading libraries **wrongly**, not merely ignoring an opcode:

- A region's `key` lost to a group's `lokey`/`hikey`. Any library that sets a
  key range on a `<group>` and then `#include`s a per-key region list written
  as `key=N` -- a very common layout -- had **every region span the whole
  keyboard**. Every note then played `--layers` worth of the wrong samples,
  pitch-shifted. One affected library loaded with 7,052 of its 7,216 regions
  spanning 0..127, and middle C played samples belonging to keys 22 to 29.
- Multiple `<control> default_path` directives: the last one governed the whole
  file rather than the regions following it, so a library split into sections
  by sample folder loaded entirely from the last folder. Silently -- the wrong
  file exists, so nothing warned.

And five more: `<master>` accumulated into `<global>` instead of replacing it;
`loopstart`/`loopend` were dropped; `amp_veltrack` was ignored, so velocity
always scaled amplitude and a library that splits by velocity had it applied
twice; `loop_start`/`loop_end`/`end` mixed source and pool frames when the pool
was resampled; and `KNOWN_OPCODES` was wrong in both directions -- warning
about `pitch_keytrack`, which is honoured, and silently accepting `off_by`,
which was not read at all.

`group` on its own no longer mutes. In SFZ `group` only labels and `off_by` is
what mutes, so `group=1` with no `off_by` was cutting notes the library meant
to keep.

### A padded MIDI file no longer looks like a hang

`MidiStream::open` treated anything with a readable 8-byte header as a chunk,
so trailing zeros parsed as zero-length chunks and the walk stepped eight bytes
at a time to the end of the file. On a 6 GB file with 1.4 GB of padding after
its last track that is 172 million seek-and-read pairs -- minutes of no output,
disk idle, one core busy. The walk now stops at the first unrecognised tag with
no body and warns with the number of bytes it ignored.

### `--block-csv`

One row per block: voices alive at the admission decision, layers queued and
admitted, voices stolen and dropped, output RMS and peak. This is the
diagnostic for anything that moves at the block rate -- the audio is downstream
of those numbers, and reading them settles in seconds what a render takes
minutes to guess at.

### Speed

Unchanged. The winning prefix of each stratum was being sorted after being
selected, which is 262k elements per block for nothing: `select_nth_unstable`
is already deterministic, and deterministic order is all the mixdown needs.
Removing it paid for the new ranking exactly. Matched three-run samples on a
131 s render: 88.5 s before, 88.1 s after.


## Planned for the next release

**`lorand`/`hirand` support** is the priority and is the next thing being
worked on. It was the priority for 0.2.4 as well and did not make it -- the
release went on block-rate pumping and SFZ loading instead, both of which
turned out to be producing wrong output rather than merely missing a feature. It is one of the cheaper missing opcodes to add and it does not threaten
the determinism guarantee: the roll becomes a hash of the note id, so it varies
from note to note while two renders of the same file stay byte-identical.

Nothing else is committed. Effects, a host C ABI and realtime playback remain
out of scope for now.

MIT -- see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

`src/limiter.rs` is a port of the realtime limiter OmniConverter ships, which
came originally from Kiva; the `--limiter omni` mode is named after it. The SF2
and SFZ loaders, and the RIFF/WAVE reader and writer, were written against the
published format specifications. FLAC samples are decoded by
[claxon](https://github.com/ruuda/claxon) (Apache-2.0), which is the one format
here not read by hand. Everything else was written for this project.
